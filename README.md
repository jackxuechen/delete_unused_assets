  - [Built-in commands](#built-in-commands)

## Installation

Put it under [`dev_dependencies`], in your [`pubspec.yaml`].

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
    delete_un_used_assets: [latest-version]
```

## Usage
After running the command line at the bottom, it will search within the `assets` folder of your project
for any unused file within your project, then it will be deleted from this folder and moved to
a new folder `deleted_assets` in the root of your project with keeping track of deleted files.


### Built-in Commands

In your project root directory, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run delete_un_used_assets:start <flutterProjectPath> <assetsPath>
```

`flutterProjectPath`

- `flutterProjectPath`: flutterProjectPath

`assetsPath`

- `assetsPath`: if you want to specify the path of the assets folder, you can do it by passing the path,
but the default value is `assets`.

eg:
```bash
flutter pub run delete_un_used_assets:start C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/code/flutterproject flutter_app/images
```
